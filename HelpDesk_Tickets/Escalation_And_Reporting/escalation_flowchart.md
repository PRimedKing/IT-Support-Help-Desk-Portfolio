# Escalation Flow

## Tier 1 – Helpdesk
Handles password resets, system reboots, and first-response tickets.

## Tier 2 – Specialist
Handles hardware, OS, and software escalation.

## Tier 3 – Systems Engineer
Handles infrastructure failures, network outages, and vendor cases.

### Automated Escalation Triggers
- Ticket open > 4 hours → escalate to Tier 2.
- Ticket priority = “High” or “Critical” → auto-notify Tier 2 & 3.
- “Security breach” keyword → escalate immediately.
